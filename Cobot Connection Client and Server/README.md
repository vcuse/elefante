# Cobot Connection Client and Server

The goal of these scripts it to create a way around the wifi connection problems found within Elephant Robotic's `pymycobot` module and the MyCobot 280 M5. 

The connection server runs on the device connected to the cobot via serial port, and the client server runs on the device trying to reach the server over wifi.
