## [myStudio](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/4-BasicApplication/4.1-myStudio/)

myStudio is a "one-stop application platform for myRobot/myCobot and other robots."
* Handles firmware installations and updates
* Contains robot tutorials on use, maintenance, and repair

#### Downloads:
- [Download from GitHub](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/myStudio)
    - [Latest Release](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/myStudio/releases/)


## Steps to Run a Program:
1. Make sure you have all drivers installed onto your computer.
    * _May not be necessary. Both Python and C# can be run on the cobot without having drivers installed on Windows. - Haley_
2. Make sure the miniRobot firmware running on Basic (the base of the cobot) is up-to-date
    * Flash the newest release via myStudio
    * Newest release: **miniRobot v2.0**
3. On the Basic (the computer at the base of the cobot), navigate to the "Transponder" screen. 

### Connecting to the Cobot via Serial Port

1. Connect the cobot to your computer using the USB-C on the left-side of the cobot's LCD.
1. On the "Transponder" screen, select "USB UART". 
2. The cobot is now ready to accept instructions.

### Controlling the Cobot Arm via TCP/IP

[Instructions on how to connect to the cobot wirelessly via TCP/IP](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/7-ApplicationBasePython/7.6_TCPIP.html)

### Running on Bluetooth:

Using the `myCobot BLE` server:
1. Flash the myCobot bluetooth server, `myCobot BLE`, to your cobot's BASIC using myStudio.
2. On your bluetooth-enabled controller (your computer, mobile device, etc.), activate bluetooth and pair the device to the cobot. 
    * Your cobot will broadcast itself as `MyCobot`.

Using `miniRobot v2.0`:
1. On the "Transponder" screen, select "Bluetooth". 
2. The cobot is now broadcasting itself on Bluetooth. 
    * The cobot will broadcast itself as `mycobot280-m5`.
3. On your controller device, activate bluetooth and request to pair with the cobot. 
4. Verify that the bluetooth code displayed on your controller device is the same as the one displayed on the cobot's LCD.
    * Once you have confirmed that they are the same, select the `pair` or `confirm` option on both devices.

[myCobot Phone Controller App](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/myCobot/tree/main/Software/phone%20controller)
* Unfortunately, this controller is only a preview. All assets on the app work, however the app itself is unable to connect to the cobot via bluetooth - including when the phone itself is successfully connected.
* Excellent app design. If we could get this working, that'd be neat.

No more information was available on how to send instructions via Bluetooth.

## Rotational Movement

Elephant Robotics Documentation: Each Joint's Rotational Degrees of Movement: -160 deg. to 160 deg. or -165 deg to 165 deg

_TODO: Retest these findings on C#. - Haley_

In Python:
- Rotational Limit on Angles: 190 deg or -190 deg
    - 190 degrees = 180 degrees
    - -190 degrees = -180 degrees
- Positive and negative rotational positions are split down the origin. 
    - From 0 degrees to 179 degrees; then, from -179 degrees back to 0 degrees
    - The notch in the joint lines up when the joint in at the origin (0 degrees).
- Rotational Limits per joint:
    - On Joints 1 and 5, there is a block restricting the servos movement at 180 degrees/-180 degrees. Once this block is hit, the joint will stop movement.
    - Joints 2, 3, and 4 are restricted by other joints. 
        - Joint 2's rotational limits: -140 degrees to 140 degrees
        - Joint 3's rotational limits: -160 degrees to 160 degrees
        - Joint 4's rotational limits: -165 degrees to 150 degrees (weird)
    - There is no block nor are there restrictions on joint 6.

Min and Max Angles According to the Python API:
* Joint 1
    * Min: -1550 degrees 
    * Max: 1550 degrees 
* Joint 2
    * Min: -1650 degrees
    * Max: 1650 degrees
* Joint 3
    * Min: -1650 degrees
    * Max: 1650 degrees
* Joint 4
    * Min: -1650 degrees
    * Max: 1650 degrees
* Joint 5
    * Min: -1750 degrees
    * Max: 1750 degrees
* Joint 6
    * Min: -17500 degrees
    * Max: 21608 degrees

Notes:
* Despite all movement commands operating in degrees between -180, 0, and 180 **or less*, the functions that return the minimum and maximum angle possible return coterminal angle values (?).
    * Adding onto this, some joints cannot move a complete 360 degrees.

### Python

* [Installing the `pymycobot` library](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/7-ApplicationBasePython/7.1_download.html#714-preparations)

#### Downloads:
- [`pymycobot` Github](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot)
    - [Latest Release](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot/releases/)
    - Use `pip` or `pip3` to install `pymycobot` to your enviornment.

#### Documentation
 * [`pymycobot` library documentation from Elephant Robotics](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/7-ApplicationBasePython/)
 * [Python API for myCobot](https://pypi.org/project/pymycobot/)
 * [`pymycobot` GitHub ReadMe](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot/blob/main/README.md)

Example Library Use in Python:
```python
from pymycobot import MyCobot, Angle, Coord, utils
```

Example Use of Coordinates and Joing Angles: The Cobot Sits and Stands Up Again
```python
from pymycobot.mycobot import MyCobot
import time

mc = MyCobot('COM3', 115200)
mc.power_on()

#For the best results, wait for 5s after opening the serial port.
time.sleep(5)

print("cobot is now active")

print("moving bot via coordinates")

coords = mc.get_coords()
print(coords)

mc.send_coords([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], 80, 1)
time.sleep(5)

coords = mc.get_coords()
print(coords)

print("moving bot via angles")

angles = mc.get_angles()
print(angles)

mc.send_angles([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], 80)
time.sleep(5)

angles = mc.get_angles()
print(angles)

mc.power_off()
```

Example use of rotating the joint incrementally:
```python
from pymycobot.mycobot import MyCobot
import time

mc = MyCobot('COM3', 115200)
mc.power_on()
time.sleep(5)

for x in range(0, 90):
    mc.send_angle(Angle.J1.value, x, 80)

mc.power_off()
```


#### Notes:
- Tested on **pymycobot v2.7.5**
- The Python API does not completely include or describe all the available functions in the API.
- While `mc.power_on()` Servos will lock but be manuverable after every movement command.
    - Servos can be manually unlocked via `mc.release_all_servos()`
    - Servos will move back to its original position in this state
- Servos become fully manuverable again after the `mc.power_off()` is run.

For Best Results:
- Wait at least 5 seconds for the cobot to connect to the serial port.
- To move from one angle to another, we recommend instead moving in one-angle increments to the next angle until the cobot reaches its destimation.
    - If you wish to not use this appraoch, wait 5 seconds after sending angles and coordinates across a difference of movement.

### C#

* Recommends using VSCode 2019
* [Source Code](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/Mycobot.csharp)
* [Dynamic Library](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/9-ApplicationBaseCSharp/9.2-build.html)


Tested with the Following Environment:
* Visual Studio 2022
* .NET SDK 5.0.409
* .NET SDK 6.0.301
* [Mycobot.csharp v1.2](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/Mycobot.csharp/releases)

#### [Recommended Steps for Set-Up](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/9-ApplicationBaseCSharp/9.2-build.html#922-running-in-windows)

1. Setup Your C# Environment
    * Download and install the [.NET core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and [.NET framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework) from Microsoft.
        * *Skip this step if you already have C# installed or have installed C# through Unity on your device.*
    * Elephant Robotics also provides these libraries as a part of their [latest release](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/Mycobot.csharp/releases/tag/v1.2). *See the notes below before downloading.*
        * For Windows Users: 
            * Download `net.core.zip` and `net.framework.zip`
        * For Linux Users: 
            * Download `MyCobot.csharp.tar.gz`
2. Download the Source Code from GitHub
    * The source code includes the API for running the cobot (`MyCobot.cs`) and a sample code for first-time use (`Program.cs`).
3. Open the Source Code and Open the Solution on VSCode or Visual Studio. 
4. Change the port number of the cobot in `Program.cs` to match the port number of your cobot.
    * For Windows Users:
        * Use the [Device Manager](https://help.fleetmon.com/en/articles/2010900-how-do-i-get-my-com-port-number-windows) to identify the Cobot's port number. 
    * For Linux Users: 
        * Elephant Robotics expects the cobot's port number to be `/dev/ttyAMA0`.
5. Run the project.

Example Use of Coordinates and Angles:
```C#
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace Mycobot.csharp
{
    class Test
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            MyCobot mc = new MyCobot("COM3");
            //Raspberry Pi robotic arm serial port name: /dev/ttyAMA0
            
            mc.Open();

            //After Windows opens the serial port, you need to wait for 5s.
            //After Windows opens the serial port, the BASIC at the bottom will restart.
            Thread.Sleep(5000);

            int[] coords = new[] {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
            mc.SendCoords(coords, 80, 1);
            Thread.Sleep(5000);
            var recCoords = mc.GetCoords();
            foreach (var v in recCoords)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(v);
            }


            int[] angles = new[] {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
            mc.SendAngles(angles, 80);
            var recAngles = mc.GetAngles();
            foreach (var v in recAngles)
            {
               Console.WriteLine(v);
            }

            mc.Close();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Running on a Raspberry Pi

* Follow the steps to setup a C# enviornment above, if you haven't already.
* The main difference in set-up and use is the port number of the cobot. On Raspberry Pi, Elephant Robotics expects the cobot's port number to be:
    * `/dev/ttyAMA0`

#### Working with Unity:
- Player API compatibility level must be changed to either ".NET framework" or ".NET 2.0" to recognize System.IO.Ports. 
    - System.IO.Ports is what Elephant Robotics use to open the serial port
    - https://forum.unity.com/threads/cant-use-system-io-ports.141316/
- Import the `MyCobot.cs` script from the GitHub source code.
- Add two dependencies to your script:
    - To use the cobot: `using Mycobot.csharp`
    - To sleep: `using System.Threading`

Current Unity Problem: Unity not communicating with the cobot
- Serial Port is opening correctly
- Angles not being sent

Researching Solutions
- Switch to IL2CPP scripting backend instead of Mono
    - No Response
- Figure out how to include .NET 2.0 libraries
    - Same error as before; cant see the System.IO namespace

#### Notes:
- Must still navigate to the "Transponder" page to properly send angles/coord. to the cobot; however, it automatically reboots the computer (Basic) after each use. This means you have to navigate to the "Transponder" page every time you want to run your program.
    - This doesnt happen in Python.
    - Is there a way to turn this off?
    - Looked in the [Microsoft Doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.ports.serialport?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0) and the reboot signal doesnt seem to be coming from here
- The .NET libraries provided with Elephant Robotics' [latest release](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/Mycobot.csharp/releases/tag/v1.2) were oddly unnecessary to run the Cobot on C# alone. More testing is needed to prove this.
