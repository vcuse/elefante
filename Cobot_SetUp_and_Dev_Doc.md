* Handles firmware installations and updates
* Contains robot tutorials on use, maintenance, and repair

#### Downloads:
- [Official Download from Elephant Robotics](https://www.elephantrobotics.com/en/downloads/)


#### Steps to Run a Program:
* Make sure you have all drivers installed onto your computer 

_Note to Self: determine if the CP34X driver will run on its own. Had to install both before I got it to work. - Haley_

_Note to Self: got it running with no drivers when using C#?? - Haley_

* Make sure the miniRobot firmware running on Basic (the base of the cobot) is up-to-date
    * Flash the newest release via myStudio
* On the Basic (the computer at the base of the cobot), navigate to the "Transponder" screen. 
* You are now ready to run your desired program.

#### Running on Bluetooth:

myCobot BLE <- bluetooth server

### Python

* [Installing the `pymycobot` library](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/7-ApplicationBasePython/7.1_download.html#714-preparations)

#### Downloads:
- [pymycobot Github](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot)


#### Documentation
 * [`pymycobot` library documentation from Elephant Robotics](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/7-ApplicationBasePython/)
 * [Python API for myCobot](https://pypi.org/project/pymycobot/)

Example Library Use in Python:
```python
from pymycobot import MyCobot, Angle, Coord, utils
```

Example Use of Coordinates and Joing Angles: The Cobot Sits and Stands Up Again
```python
from pymycobot.mycobot import MyCobot
import time

mc = MyCobot('COM3', 115200)
mc.power_on()
print("cobot is now active")

print("moving bot via coordinates")

coords = mc.get_coords()
print(coords)

mc.send_coords([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], 80, 1)
time.sleep(5)

coords = mc.get_coords()
print(coords)

print("moving bot via angles")

angles = mc.get_angles()
print(angles)

mc.send_angles([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], 80)
time.sleep(5)

angles = mc.get_angles()
print(angles)
```

#### Notes:
- The Python API is not complete.
- Servos will lock but be manuverable after every movement command.
    - Servos can be manually unlocked via `mc.release_all_servos()`
    - Servos will move back to its original position in this state

### C#

* Recommends using VSCode 2019
* [Source Code](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/Mycobot.csharp)
* [Dynamic Library](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/9-ApplicationBaseCSharp/9.2-build.html)


Tested with the Following Environment:
* Visual Studio 2022
* .NET SDK 5.0.409
* .NET SDK 6.0.301

#### [Recommended Steps for Set-Up](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/9-ApplicationBaseCSharp/9.2-build.html#922-running-in-windows)

1. Setup Your C# Environment
    * Download and install the [.NET core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and [.NET framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework) from Microsoft.
    * *Skip this step if you already have C# installed or have installed C# through Unity on your device.*
    * Elephant Robotics also provides these libraries as a part of their [latest release](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/Mycobot.csharp/releases/tag/v1.2). *See the notes below before downloading.*
        * For Windows Users: 
            * Download `net.core.zip` and `net.framework.zip`
        * For Linux Users: 
            * Download `MyCobot.csharp.tar.gz`
2. Download the Source Code from GitHub
    * The source code includes the API for running the cobot (`MyCobot.cs`) and a sample code for first-time use (`Program.cs`).
3. Open the Source Code and Open the Solution on VSCode or Visual Studio. 
4. Change the port number of the cobot in `Program.cs` to match the port number of your cobot.
    * For Windows Users:
        * Use the [Device Manager](https://help.fleetmon.com/en/articles/2010900-how-do-i-get-my-com-port-number-windows) to identify the Cobot's port number. 
    * For Linux Users: 
        * Elephant Robotics expects the cobot's port number to be `/dev/ttyAMA0`.
5. Run the project.

Example Use of Angles:
```C#

```

#### Running on a Raspberry Pi

* Follow the steps to setup a C# enviornment above, if you haven't already.
* The main difference in set-up and use is the port number of the cobot. On Raspberry Pi, Elephant Robotics expects the cobot's port number to be:
    * `/dev/ttyAMA0`

#### Working with Unity:
- Player API compatibility level must be changed to either ".NET framework" or ".NET 2.0" to recognize System.IO.Ports. 
    - System.IO.Ports is what Elephant Robotics use to open the serial port
    - https://forum.unity.com/threads/cant-use-system-io-ports.141316/
- Import the `MyCobot.cs` script from the GitHub source code.
- Add two dependencies to your script:
    - To use the cobot: `using Mycobot.csharp`
    - To sleep: `using System.Threading`

Current Unity Problem: Unity not communicating with the cobot
- Serial Port is opening correctly
- Angles not being sent

Researching Solutions
- Switch to IL2CPP scripting backend instead of Mono
    - No Response
- Figure out how to include .NET 2.0 libraries
    - Same error as before; cant see the System.IO namespace

#### Notes:
- Must still navigate to the "Transponder" page to properly send angles/coord. to the cobot; however, it automatically reboots the computer (Basic) after each use. This means you have to navigate to the "Transponder" page every time you want to run your program.
    - This doesnt happen in Python.
    - Is there a way to turn this off?
    - Looked in the [Microsoft Doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.ports.serialport?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0) and the reboot signal doesnt seem to be coming from here
- The .NET libraries provided with Elephant Robotics' [latest release](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/Mycobot.csharp/releases/tag/v1.2) were oddly unnecessary to run the Cobot on C# alone. More testing is needed to prove this.
