## Rotational Movement

Elephant Robotics Documentation: Each Joint's Rotational Degrees of Movement: -160 deg. to 160 deg. or -165 deg to 165 deg

_TODO: Retest these findings on new miniRobot version and C#. - Haley_

In Python:
- Rotational Limit on Angles: 190 deg or -190 deg
    - 190 degrees = 180 degrees
    - -190 degrees = -180 degrees
- Negative angles sent rotate the cobot clockwise.
- Positive angles sent rotate the clock counter-clockwise.
- Positive and negative rotational positions are split down the origin. 
    - From 0 degrees to 179 degrees; then, from -179 degrees back to 0 degrees
- Unfortunately, the cobot is not aware of its current rotational position.
    - _Currently testing this section. - Haley_
    - On Joints 1 and 5, there is a block restricting the servos movement at -3 degrees. Once this block is hit, the joint will stop movement.
    - On Joint 1:
        - Rotational movement is locked to the positive range of rotational movement.
        - When the user attempts to rotate the cobot into a negative rotational position (-90 degrees, for example), the cobot attempts to reach that position by rotating counter-clockwise.
    - Joints 2, 3, and 4 are restricted by other joints. 
        - Joint 2's rotational limits: -140 degrees to 140 degrees
        - Joint 3's rotational limits: -160 degrees to 160 degrees
        - Joint 4's rotational limits: -165 degrees to 150 degrees (weird)
    - Joint 5
        - (testing)
    - There is no block nor are there restrictions on joint 6.

### Python

* [Installing the `pymycobot` library](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/7-ApplicationBasePython/7.1_download.html#714-preparations)

#### Downloads:
- [`pymycobot` Github](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot)
    - [Latest Release](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot/releases/)
    - Use `pip` or `pip3` to install `pymycobot` to your enviornment.

#### Documentation
 * [`pymycobot` library documentation from Elephant Robotics](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/7-ApplicationBasePython/)
 * [Python API for myCobot](https://pypi.org/project/pymycobot/)
 * [`pymycobot` GitHub ReadMe](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/pymycobot/blob/main/README.md)

Example Library Use in Python:
```python
from pymycobot import MyCobot, Angle, Coord, utils
```

Example Use of Coordinates and Joing Angles: The Cobot Sits and Stands Up Again
```python
from pymycobot.mycobot import MyCobot
import time

mc = MyCobot('COM3', 115200)
mc.power_on()

#For the best results, wait for 5s after opening the serial port.
time.sleep(5)

print("cobot is now active")

print("moving bot via coordinates")

coords = mc.get_coords()
print(coords)

mc.send_coords([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], 80, 1)
time.sleep(5)

coords = mc.get_coords()
print(coords)

print("moving bot via angles")

angles = mc.get_angles()
print(angles)

mc.send_angles([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0], 80)
time.sleep(5)

angles = mc.get_angles()
print(angles)

mc.power_off()
```

#### Notes:
- Tested on **pymycobot v2.7.5**
- The Python API is not complete.
- While `mc.power_on()` Servos will lock but be manuverable after every movement command.
    - Servos can be manually unlocked via `mc.release_all_servos()`
    - Servos will move back to its original position in this state
- Servos become fully manuverable again after the `mc.power_off()` is run.

For Best Results:
- Wait 5 seconds for the cobot to connect to the serial port.
- Wait 5 seconds after sending angles and coordinates.

### C#

* Recommends using VSCode 2019
* [Source Code](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/Mycobot.csharp)
* [Dynamic Library](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/9-ApplicationBaseCSharp/9.2-build.html)


Tested with the Following Environment:
* Visual Studio 2022
* .NET SDK 5.0.409
* .NET SDK 6.0.301
* [Mycobot.csharp v1.2](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/Mycobot.csharp/releases)

#### [Recommended Steps for Set-Up](https://docs.elephantrobotics.com/docs/gitbook-en/9-ApplicationBaseCSharp/9.2-build.html#922-running-in-windows)

1. Setup Your C# Environment
    * Download and install the [.NET core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) and [.NET framework](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework) from Microsoft.
        * *Skip this step if you already have C# installed or have installed C# through Unity on your device.*
    * Elephant Robotics also provides these libraries as a part of their [latest release](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/Mycobot.csharp/releases/tag/v1.2). *See the notes below before downloading.*
        * For Windows Users: 
            * Download `net.core.zip` and `net.framework.zip`
        * For Linux Users: 
            * Download `MyCobot.csharp.tar.gz`
2. Download the Source Code from GitHub
    * The source code includes the API for running the cobot (`MyCobot.cs`) and a sample code for first-time use (`Program.cs`).
3. Open the Source Code and Open the Solution on VSCode or Visual Studio. 
4. Change the port number of the cobot in `Program.cs` to match the port number of your cobot.
    * For Windows Users:
        * Use the [Device Manager](https://help.fleetmon.com/en/articles/2010900-how-do-i-get-my-com-port-number-windows) to identify the Cobot's port number. 
    * For Linux Users: 
        * Elephant Robotics expects the cobot's port number to be `/dev/ttyAMA0`.
5. Run the project.

Example Use of Coordinates and Angles:
```C#
using System;
using System.Threading;

namespace Mycobot.csharp
{
    class Test
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            MyCobot mc = new MyCobot("COM3");
            //Raspberry Pi robotic arm serial port name: /dev/ttyAMA0
            
            mc.Open();

            //After Windows opens the serial port, you need to wait for 5s.
            //After Windows opens the serial port, the BASIC at the bottom will restart.
            Thread.Sleep(5000);

            int[] coords = new[] {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
            mc.SendCoords(coords, 80, 1);
            Thread.Sleep(5000);
            var recCoords = mc.GetCoords();
            foreach (var v in recCoords)
            {
                Console.WriteLine(v);
            }


            int[] angles = new[] {0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
            mc.SendAngles(angles, 80);
            var recAngles = mc.GetAngles();
            foreach (var v in recAngles)
            {
               Console.WriteLine(v);
            }

            mc.Close();
        }
    }
}
```

#### Running on a Raspberry Pi

* Follow the steps to setup a C# enviornment above, if you haven't already.
* The main difference in set-up and use is the port number of the cobot. On Raspberry Pi, Elephant Robotics expects the cobot's port number to be:
    * `/dev/ttyAMA0`

#### Working with Unity:
- Player API compatibility level must be changed to either ".NET framework" or ".NET 2.0" to recognize System.IO.Ports. 
    - System.IO.Ports is what Elephant Robotics use to open the serial port
    - https://forum.unity.com/threads/cant-use-system-io-ports.141316/
- Import the `MyCobot.cs` script from the GitHub source code.
- Add two dependencies to your script:
    - To use the cobot: `using Mycobot.csharp`
    - To sleep: `using System.Threading`

Current Unity Problem: Unity not communicating with the cobot
- Serial Port is opening correctly
- Angles not being sent

Researching Solutions
- Switch to IL2CPP scripting backend instead of Mono
    - No Response
- Figure out how to include .NET 2.0 libraries
    - Same error as before; cant see the System.IO namespace

#### Notes:
- Must still navigate to the "Transponder" page to properly send angles/coord. to the cobot; however, it automatically reboots the computer (Basic) after each use. This means you have to navigate to the "Transponder" page every time you want to run your program.
    - This doesnt happen in Python.
    - Is there a way to turn this off?
    - Looked in the [Microsoft Doc](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.ports.serialport?view=dotnet-plat-ext-6.0) and the reboot signal doesnt seem to be coming from here
- The .NET libraries provided with Elephant Robotics' [latest release](https://github.com/elephantrobotics/Mycobot.csharp/releases/tag/v1.2) were oddly unnecessary to run the Cobot on C# alone. More testing is needed to prove this.
